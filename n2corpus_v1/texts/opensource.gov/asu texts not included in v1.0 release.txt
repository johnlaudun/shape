As noted in the file in the root of the directory, the ASU texts are currently marked FOUO (For Official Use Only) by the U.S. Government, and have not yet been approved for release to the general public.  As of this writing (March 2014), we are in the process of seeking permission to release these texts.  When that permission is granted, we will release a new version of the corpus that includes those texts.
